    "NumPy or Numerical Python is a powerful library to handle complex matrix operations. In our workshops so far, we have not yet come across a data structure which is designed for purely mathematical operations on lists or arrays. While we can design a pseudo-matrix by embedding list data structures within other lists, there is no easy functionality to perform operations like adding, subtracting, multiplying or inverting matrices. Numerical python solves this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a background in MATLAB or R, you are likely familiar with the built-in matrix functionality. In MATLAB, the core data structure is a matrix. In this language you interact with objects primarily through indexing it within a larger structure. R also provides functionality to deal with matrices, but with less elegance than MATLAB. The key differences between all of these languages (Python, MATLAB, and R) is the additional functionality that can be leveraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both MATLAB and R are both capable of writing complex programs and are standards in many fields (engineering, statistics), Data Science operates at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and software. In software, one of the primary goals of code is to be able to be used in a Machine Learning Pipeline. This typically involves writing scripts which can be easily implemented into an automated workflow of reading data, processing data, fitting a model, and serving results. For this use case, Python is most productive as back-end code defining the server to web-driven templates can all be written natively in Python.\n",

To begin, we will import the NumPy library using the following line:"

    "## Application Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "For this application problem, we will imagine a world with an internet containing only four websites. Since this world is so small, you have been tasked with building the search engine for this internet (for better or worse). It seems reasonable to think about traffic moving between sites and somehow finding the proportion of time people spend on any given website. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we are describing is a [Markov Chain](http://wikipedia.org/Markov) whereby we define _transition probabilities_ between nodes in a graph. Consider the graph below as an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unfamiliar with Markov Chains entirely, this [website](http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/) has an excellent interactive visualization to help you build intuition quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we think about finding the proportion of time people spend on any given website, we are mathematically interested in the stationary distribution of the Markov Chain. The stationary distribution is the probability that we are on a given website at any given time. If we can find a way to rank how likely we are to be on a certain website, we can determine the order in which to rank the websites on our search engine!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tier 1 -- Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way of computing the stationary distribution of a Markov Chain is to multiply the matrix by itself multiple times. This is away of thinking about \"simulating\" the markov process over and over. Eventually, we will reach a matrix which has some non-zero numbers along the diagonal elements and zeros elsewhere. These non-zero numbers correspond to the proportion of time we are expected to spend on that website. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this tier, write a function which multiplies a matrix times itself a specified number of times. Use this function to find the stationary distribution of the provided Markov Chain. If interested, you can compare your answer to the one found by using [this NumPy function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.matrix_power.html). (Import will be required)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tier 2 -- Eigenvalues\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained by [this Brilliant article](https://brilliant.org/wiki/stationary-distributions/), the eigenvalues correspond to values of the stationary distribution. For this tier, apply the eigenvalue/vector functionality from the notebook to find the stationary distribution of the provided Markov Chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tier 3 -- Monte Carlo Markov Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "The final way to find the stationary distribution is to use Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo is a general class of algorithms which describe simulating a large number of events and examining the results. In this case, we can think about simulating people visiting and traveling across each of these sites by using the transition probabilities presented. This process is also known as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) and is a fundamental algorithm underlying Bayesian inference methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tier, write a simulation which tracks the locations of a large number of internet users and their traffic across the websites. You will need to use the transition probabilities to move between nodes. [This function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) could make this process easier."
