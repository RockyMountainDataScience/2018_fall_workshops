    "# Functional Programing\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it is: \n",
    "    Functional programming takes tasks and relegates them to a different area of your program\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Why it is used: \n",
    "    Creating a function allows code to be re-used throughout your program. It also can simplify the de-bugging process\n",
    "    \n",
    "### How it is used:\n",
    "    Two major components go into writing and using a function:\n",
    "        a. Function Definition - area of code that defines:\n",
    "            1. Function Name\n",
    "            2. Function Code (operations defined inside the function)\n",
    "            3. Function Inputs - storage spaces for the information the function needs to run\n",
    "            4. Function Output - information the function sends back to the code\n",
    "        b. Function Call - used whenever the programmer wants to run the function:\n",
    "            1. Feeds information into input storage spaces\n",
    "            2. Stores information sent from the function as output"

    "# Application Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In all Social Networking sites, recommendations are made to users on who to follow. These recommendations can be sophisticated and based on a complex algorithm which computes similarity based on a number of metrics. Often, the recommendations are based on simple questions like \"Do two people have a mutual friend but do not know each other?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Our application problem for this workshop revolves around understanding a Graph data structure. What we are interested in doing is modeling the following social network and making a recommendation in order to increase the number of connections. The following image provides the imaginary social network we will work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"SocialNetwork.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some initial recommendations we can consider making?\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how we look at it, we can think about the number of degrees away one person is from another. Degrees here implies the number of connections. For example, Tristan and Catherine know each other directly. Therefore, since the their direct relationship is the shortest, they are only one degree apart. However, there may be someone Catherine knows at MSU who Tristan does not. However, he is only one additional connection away. Therefore, Tristan is two degrees away from someone Catherine knows directly, but Tristan does not. In our example social graph, Al and Cate are two degrees away since we need to go through two connections either through Bob or Derek to generate a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think about building an algorithm which will recommend for a general $n$-degrees away, but for the remainder of this workshop we are interested in using the data structures we have presented to model the social network we have provided and code a function to use that data structure to make a recommendation for connections which are only two degrees away. There are many ways to model this, and we encourage collaboration. "
